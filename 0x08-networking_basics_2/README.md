# 0x08. Networking basics #1


## Tasks

### 0. Change your home IP

Write a Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server with the below requirements.

Requirements:

-   `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
-   `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`.



If you’re running this script on a machine that you’ll continue to use, be sure to revert `localhost` to `127.0.0.1`. Otherwise, a lot of things will stop working!

### 1. Show attached IPs

Write a Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine it’s executed on.

Obviously, the IPs displayed may be different depending on which machine you are running the script on.
